## Context

- Learning directory: !`ls -d study/.learning 2>/dev/null`
- Current topic: !`ls study/.learning/ 2>/dev/null`

**Note:** If `study/.learning/` doesn't exist, inform user to run `/learn [topic]`. Check topic folders (ignore `scripts/`).

**Note:** After getting topic slug, read the necessary files:

- `study/.learning/<topic-slug>/metadata.json`
- `study/.learning/<topic-slug>/progress.md` (last 30 lines)
- `study/.learning/<topic-slug>/syllabus.md`
- `study/.learning/<topic-slug>/review_schedule.json`

## Your Task

Generate an encouraging progress report showing learning journey and next steps.

**If no `study/.learning/`:**

- Inform: "No learning in progress yet. Use `/learn [topic]` to start!"

**Calculate metrics:**

- Sessions completed (from metadata)
- Days since start (from created_at)
- Concepts learned (count from progress.md)
- Syllabus progress (checked `[x]` vs total `[ ]`)
- Reviews completed (from review_schedule.json)
- Current phase (from syllabus position)

**Present report:**

```markdown
